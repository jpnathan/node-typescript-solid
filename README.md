# Node Typescript SOLID API

## Single responsibility principle
-- A class should have one, and only one, reason to change

## Open-closed principle
" Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. "
-- It should be possible to extend the behavoir of a class without  modifying it

## Liskov Substitution principle
" Child classes should never break the parent classâ€™ type definitions. "
-- Subclasses should be substitutable for their superclasses

## Interface segregation principle
-- Many small, client-specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface

## Dependency inversion principle
-- Depends on abstractions, not implementation
